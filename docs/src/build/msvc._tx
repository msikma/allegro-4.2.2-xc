MSVC notes

   Status: complete.

   The screensaver example is built, but you must copy <tt>scrsave.scr</tt> to
   your <tt>windows/system</tt> directory (or <tt>winnt/system32</tt> directory
   under Windows NT/2k/XP) if you want to test it.
   
   You may also want to refer to one of the following, as they may include
   more up to date information:
   
     <ul><li><link>http://wiki.allegro.cc/Build/MSVC_6</a>
     <li><link>http://wiki.allegro.cc/Build/MSVC_7</a>
     <li><link>http://wiki.allegro.cc/Build/MSVC_8</a>
     </ul>

@heading
Project Files

   Project files for MSVC 6, 7, and 8 are included in the /build/msvc directory.
   If you choose to use them, you can ignore the other sections of this
   document. (The "Using Allegro" section would still apply.)
   
   You do need to make sure you have recent versions of the DirectX and
   Windows Platform headers, as described in the "Required software section."
   
   Before you can use the project files, you must first double-click on the
   /build/msvc/pre-build-msvc.bat file. Then open the Allegro project file
   and select Build / Batch Build from the menu. Select the versions you want to
   build and then press the Build button.
   
   (Note that under MSVC 6 you may need to repeat the build process several times
   due to compiler bugs.) 
   
   If everything builds successfully, you'll need to copy some files to finish
   the installation:
   
   <ul><li>Copy the contents of C:\allegro\include to "Visual Studio\VC\include"
   <li>Copy the .lib files from C:\allegro\lib\msvc to "Visual Studio\VC\lib"
   <li>Copy the .dll files from C:\allegro\lib\msvc to C:\Windows\System32 
   </ul>
     
   The most common location of Visual Studio is "C:\Program Files\Microsoft
   Visual Studio."
   
   Then you can build the rest of the examples, demos, tests, and tools by 
   opening up their respective project files and selectiong Batch Build from
   the menu.
      

@heading
Required software

   <ul><li>Microsoft Visual C++.
   <li>Recent set of DirectX and other Windows SDK headers.
   <li>A GNU environment to run GNU tools with, such as DJGPP, MinGW or Cygwin.
   Depending on which one you choose, you will need the following packages:
   
      <ul><li>DJGPP: compiler (<tt>djdev*.zip</tt>, <tt>gcc*b.zip</tt>, <tt>bnu*b.zip</tt>).<br>
	 GNU make (<tt>mak*b.zip</tt>).<br>
	 Optional: GNU sed (<tt>sed*b.zip</tt>). Used by "<tt>make depend</tt>" and
	 "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".<br>
	 Optional: GNU sort (<tt>txt*b.zip</tt>). Used by "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".<br><br>

      <li>MinGW: compiler (mingw-runtime, gcc, binutils).<br>
	 GNU make.<br>
	 Optional: GNU sed. Used by "<tt>make depend</tt>" and "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".<br>
	 Optional: GNU sort (textutils). Used by "<tt>fixdll.bat</tt>".<br>
	 Optional: w32api. See next section about details.<br><br>

      <li>Cygwin: compiler (cygwin, gcc, binutils).<br>
	 GNU make.<br>
	 Optional: GNU sed. Used by "<tt>make depend</tt>" and "<tt>fixdll.sh</tt>"<br>
	 Optional: GNU sort (textutils). Used by "<tt>fixdll.sh</tt>".<br><br>
   </ul></ul>
   Allegro should work ok with MSVC versions 4, 5, 6, 7.0 (.NET),
   7.1 (.NET 2003) and 8.0 (.NET 2005). However note that the lowest tested
   version is 6.

   The DirectX SDK can be obtained directly from Microsoft. An old version 
   of the headers is included with MSVC 6, but Allegro requires more recent 
   files. You should either copy the current headers into your MSVC include 
   and lib directories, or alter your <tt>INCLUDE</tt> and <tt>LIB</tt> environment variables
   to put the DirectX SDK files in front of the standard MSVC locations.

   If you choose to use DJGPP as your GNU environment, the DJGPP compiler and
   associated tools can be downloaded from your nearest SimTel mirror site,
   in the <tt>/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/</tt> directory, or you can use the zip picker
   on <link>http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/</a>. See the djgpp <tt>readme.1st</tt> file for
   informations about how to install DJGPP.

   If you choose MinGW, download the MinGW compiler and associated tools from
   '<link>http://www.mingw.org</a>' or '<link>http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/</a>'. You
   can download the complete distribution instead of the individual packages
   if you don't want to install each package manually.

   If you choose Cygwin, get <tt>setup.exe</tt> from '<link>http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/</a>'.
   Start the Cygwin setup program and download the required packages. Then
   install the packages (run <tt>setup.exe</tt> once more). When setup asks you which
   line endings you want, select unix-style instead of DOS.

   Remember that the chosen set of tools have to be on your PATH during the
   building of Allegro.



@heading
Installing Allegro

   This is a source-only distribution, so you will have to compile Allegro 
   before you can use it. To do this you should:

@hnode Setting up the environment

   Set up your environment so that MSVC can be used from the commandline.
   You probably have a <tt>vcvars32.bat</tt> file that will do this for you
   (the exact location of this file depends on your MSVC version and folder
   where you have MSVC installed, e.g. for MSVC 6 it is usually 
   <tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin</tt>, for MSVC 8 
   <tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\Bin</tt> etc.).
   You will have to run this file every time you open a DOS box or configure 
   the environment variables in Control Panel/System/Environment (autoexec.bat
   for Win 9x/ME). 

@hnode Configuring Allegro

   To configure Allegro for your compiler please run in the command prompt:
<textblock>
       fix.bat msvc6  - for MSVC 6 and older
       fix.bat msvc7  - for MSVC 7 (.NET) and 7.1 (.NET 2003)
       fix.bat msvc8  - for MSVC 8 (.NET 2005)
       fix.bat icl    - for Intel compiler
<endblock>

@hnode Long paths handling

   Normally you can skip this section, unless you have some problem with
   building Allegro.

   The make process needs all the path variables to be in DOS 8.3 format, and
   since MSVC is usually installed in something like
   "<tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003</tt>",
   this may cause a problem. This should normally be handled by
   <tt>fix.bat</tt>, so you probably don't need to worry about this. However you
   can run "<tt>echo %MSVCDir%</tt>" (<tt>%VCINSTALLDIR%</tt> under MSVC 8)
   from the command line to see if it contain spaces.
   If you are using MSVC 6 or lower the output should already be in DOS 8.3
   format so you should not have any troubles. With higher versions of MSVC
   it will probably show the long path with spaces. Normally, <tt>fix.bat</tt>
   will try to convert it to DOS 8.3 format automatically. You can disable this
   conversion by passing the <tt>--nomsvcpaths</tt> parameter to <tt>fix.bat</tt>
   (note that this conversion is automatically disabled when using "<tt>msvc6</tt>").

   If you want to handle this yourself manually, you will have to edit
   <tt>vcvars32.bat</tt> so that it sets the 8.3 paths, not the long versions.
   To get 8.3 path names, you can use the command prompt (<tt>cmd.exe</tt>).
   Type in "<tt>dir /x</tt>" to get a listing of the 8.3 file and directory
   names alongside of their full names. You can also use the DOS prompt
   (<tt>command.exe</tt>) and "<tt>dir</tt>", but this will only show
   you the 8.3 names.

@hnode Building from SVN

   If you are compiling from SVN, you need to run "<tt>make depend</tt>" and
   "<tt>misc/fixdll.sh</tt>" before continuing as explained below, or the
   library will fail to build because of missing <tt>.inc</tt> files.

@hnode Building Allegro

   If you are using Cygwin as the GNU environment, start the Cygwin bash shell
   from the command prompt (if you used the command prompt to run <tt>vcvars32.bat</tt>
   then you must start Cygwin in the same command-prompt window you used to
   run <tt>vcvars32.bat</tt> unless you configured the environment variables in Control
   Panel/System/Environment). This is usually done via "<tt>C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat</tt>".

   Go to the directory where you have installed Allegro by using '<tt>cd</tt>'.

   Type "<tt>make</tt>". Then go do something interesting while everything compiles.
   When it finishes compiling, type "<tt>make install</tt>" to set the library up
   ready for use.

   If you are using MSVC 8 and want to embed manifest files to executables
   (by default manifests are just embedded in the DLL), run "<tt>misc\embedman.bat all</tt>"
   from the command prompt (Cygwin users run "<tt>misc/embedman.bat all</tt>").

   If you also want to install a debugging version of the library (highly 
   recommended), now type "<tt>make install DEBUGMODE=1</tt>". Case is important, so
   it must be <tt>DEBUGMODE</tt>, not <tt>debugmode</tt>!

   If you also want to install a profiling version of the library, now type 
   "<tt>make install PROFILEMODE=1</tt>".

   If you want statically linked libraries as well as the default DLLs, pass
   additionally "<tt>STATICLINK=1</tt>" to the make commands above.

   If your copy of Allegro doesn't include the <tt>makefile.dep</tt> dependency files
   (unlikely, unless you have run "<tt>make veryclean</tt>" at some point or are
   building the SVN version), you can regenerate them by running
   "<tt>make depend</tt>".

   If your copy of Allegro doesn't include the linker .def file (unlikely, 
   unless you have run "<tt>make veryclean</tt>" at some point or are building the SVN
   version), you can regenerate it by running "<tt>misc\fixdll.bat</tt>". Cygwin users
   can run "<tt>misc/fixdll.sh</tt>" instead.

   Once the build is finished you can recover some disk space by running
   "<tt>make compress</tt>", which uses the UPX program to compress the executable
   files and the optimized dll. Before running "<tt>make compress</tt>", you must set
   the environment variable UPX_BIN to point to <tt>upx.exe</tt>. You will have to
   do run "<tt>make compress</tt>" before "<tt>make install</tt>" if you want the compressed
   dll to be copied to the windows directory. To recover even more disk
   space, you can run "<tt>make clean</tt>" to get rid of all the temporary files and
   HTML format documentation.



@heading
Using Allegro

   All the Allegro functions, variables, and data structures are defined in 
   <tt>allegro.h</tt>. You should include this in your programs, and link with one of
   the libraries:
<textblock>
      alleg.lib       - optimised DLL import library
      alld.lib        - debugging DLL import library
      allp.lib        - profiling DLL import library
      alleg_s.lib     - statically linked optimised library
      alld_s.lib      - statically linked debugging library
      allp_s.lib      - statically linked profiling library
      alleg_s_crt.lib - statically linked optimised library 
                           with the static C runtime
<endblock>
   All above library configurations could be built with <tt>ALLEGRO_USE_C</tt> option which
   would add a "_c" suffix to them. When linking your program to such a library, you must define
   the preprocessor symbol <tt>ALLEGRO_NO_ASM</tt> before including any of the Allegro headers.

   When using a statically linked library, you must define the preprocessor
   symbol <tt>ALLEGRO_STATICLINK</tt> before including any of the Allegro headers and
   link your program against Allegro and the main Win32/DirectX libraries
   in that order (see the variable <tt>LIBRARIES</tt> in <tt>makefile.vc</tt>). You have also
   to make sure that your program is linked against the right C run-time
   library, ie. the multi-threaded DLL version of MSVCRT (or the debug
   version if you are using the debug library). You can change this option
   at Project - Settings - C/C++ - Category: Code Generation - Use run-time
   library.

   Don't forget that you need to use the <code>END_OF_MAIN()</code> macro right after
   your <code>main()</code> function!

   If you use one of the DLL versions, you will obviously need to distribute 
   the appropriate DLL along with your program: these can be found in the 
   <tt>allegro/lib/msvc/</tt> directory.

   The alleg_s_crt.lib is most useful with Visual C++ 8.0. The new C runtime that it
   uses can be difficult to distribute. By using alleg_s_crt.lib along with the 
   multi-threaded runtime (/MT) you can avoid the problem. For more information on
   deploying with VC++ 8.0, see <link>http://wiki.allegro.cc/VisualCExpress2005#Deployment</a>.
